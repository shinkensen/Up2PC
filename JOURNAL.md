Day 1: I spent almost 4 hours, just reaserching how I can do this on a limited budget, creating a base CAD model for the case and
learning how this all works. At this time its about 11:30pm and I am about to go to bed, I spent the daytime on SOM, jow the night on this 
Here are some pictures of me making the cad model, and one of the laptop mainboard I want to use

Day 2: Realized I can use slightly better components (i9-10980hk) but the problem is that its a bit more expensive and I need a seperate ccoling solution so it will be a bit janky
I honestly dont know if the 3d printing is going to be free, cheap, or expensive so Im asking in the slack server.
I'm probably going to submit the project proposal thing today because I'm also working on SOM and I want to see of this gets approved
I'll probably end up paying for like $20-$30 out of pocket if i go the i9 route (I really want to).
Its gonna be harder but its also way better and more fun. Hopefully it dosent go out of stock.

Technically Day 3: Decided on a Cardboard Case if the 3d printing is too big, finalized the BOM, and Finished up the Cad, will finish up submission requirements and submit;
