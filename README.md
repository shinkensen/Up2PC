# Up2PC
Project for Hackclub Highway, look at README for more details
(This is the Readme, look at journal for progress)
My project idea:
  What: I want to take an old/used motherboard and cpu combo or the mainboard form a laptop and transform it into a fully working desktop pc.

  Why: For a long time now, Ive been wanting a desktop computer that I can use with my monitor (instead of using the family laptop and being able to only use it for 30-60 min every day.), 
  I also really enjoy PCs and Desktop Systems but ive never been able to have the oppurtunity to build one my self. My own PC is something that Ive wanted to do for 3 years now, ever since I started garnering
  interest in this topic.

  How:
    I will make the pc by using a Cheap laptop mainboard (the one I'm looking at right now costs has an i7-9850H) which has basically every component, and also a M.2 ssd, and soddimm ddr4 ram which will cost arround $40. 
    I will also need a dell power cable for this since it was originally in a laptop. Next, I need a case which I will do out of 3d printing/cad using the hack club service. I am making the CAD design for a traditional Mini pc/SFF design with a box like figure, but with cooling vents and io port cuttouts.  //Edit: Making in a cardboard box now bc 3d printing a big thing like this is too expensive
    I will be designing it in a way so that the dimensions are on point with a dell 5501 (the actual laptop) so that it all fits perfectly. Additionally, I will be making it in a way so that it is printed in 2 pieces, the body and the cover so that its detachable for maitanence.
    One major benefit of using a buisness laptop's mainboard like this, is that in the future I can very easilly upgrade to a 32gb or even 64gb ram system and even a 4tb nvme ssd, also altough the current wifi card on it is a wifi 5, It can be easily upgraded to a 6 or 6E.
    Also, one future addon to this project is adding a screen, keyboard, trackpad, and a possible webcam to make this its own custom laptop that is readilly upgradable and very versatile. To finish up that leaves $20 which can accomadate for taxes or for maybe a better ssd, lighting, hdmi cables and more niche addons.
    Overall, I think this project has a lot of capacity and has the chance to be a project I work on and use daily for the next 5-7 years. Also this is something that I can proudly show to others as a cheap, powerful system that I build by recycling old components and restoring them to be a capable machine like this.

Aditional: Up2PC is representative of how im upcycling a electronic into a working desktop pc that I will use daliy.
